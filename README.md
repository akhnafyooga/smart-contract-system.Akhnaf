# Smart Contract System

A decentralized smart contract project built as part of the **TIF5211 – Advanced Information Systems** course.  
This project explores blockchain-based systems, particularly the use of **Ethereum** and **Solidity** to implement secure, transparent, and verifiable digital records.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a **smart contract system** that allows users to:
- Record and verify digital document hashes on the blockchain.
- Timestamp transactions for authenticity.
- Demonstrate immutability and transparency through Ethereum’s network.

The project is adapted from [dteti-sys-rsch/tif5211-iup-2025](https://github.com/dteti-sys-rsch/tif5211-iup-2025), with further development and personalization by **Akhnaf Fawzan Yogatrisna**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Solidity** – Smart contract language  
- **Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)** – Blockchain network for deployment  
- **Remix IDE / Hardhat** – For contract development and testing  
- **MetaMask** – Wallet for transaction signing  

---

## 🧩 Features
- Smart contract deployment and verification  
- Hash-based document tracking  
- Event logging and retrieval  
- Decentralized proof of existence

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
This project helped me learn:
- How to design and deploy smart contracts using Solidity  
- The concept of decentralization, consensus, and immutability  
- Real-world implementation of blockchain-based record systems
